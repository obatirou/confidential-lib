# FHEVM Confidential Library

This repository provides reusable building blocks for developing Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enabled Solidity
smart contracts on top of the FHEVM protocol by Zama. It extends the original Hardhat template with production-focused
utilities, libraries, and accompanying test harnesses that can be composed to accelerate FHE contract development.

Key reusable components shipped in this repository:

- `contracts/BoundedRandomLib.sol`: helper routines for drawing encrypted random numbers within a bounded range.
- Additional libraries and utilities will be added over time as the collection of FHE building blocks grows.

## Quick Start

For the broader setup steps refer to the
